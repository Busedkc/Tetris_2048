# Tetris_2048

- Tetris 2048 combines some properties of Tetris and 2048.
- The game play is similar to Tetris as the player can move androtate 7 different shapes each consisting of 4 square tiles(tetrominoes shown below) in the 2D playing field (grid).
- The differences are that the tiles forming tetrominoes havenumbers (positive powers of 2) and the number on each tiledetermines its color (See the image given on the right).
- Each tetromino entering the grid consists of 4 tiles randomlynumbered using either 2 or 4 (as in 2048)
